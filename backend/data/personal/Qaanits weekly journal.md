# Qaanit’s weekly journal

**Tuesday 19th August**

The day was almost the exact same as yesterday, woke up, gym, eat. When I got home I left for tutoring. Tuesdays are fairly better than Mondays as most of my other colleagues are also working and it is fun to collaborate or talk about university with them. Especially when we all try to solve a maths problem together, its always interesting to see how different we all approach the problem.

**Wednesday 20th August**

Wednesday is our rest day, so my friend did not pick me up for gym. I woke up early to instead work on a project. I have a love hate relationship with coding, love when my code works but hate when it doesn’t. But debugging is part of being a programmer so it is something I have to do, and honestly I love the challenge of finding out where I went wrong. Normally I use tracing to find where my code is or isn’t running. I prefer this traditional method over using debugging tools. I personally feel its quicker and I just have a better understanding. Other than that I use AI to help me when I receive error messages that I do not understand, and guide me to docs to help me. After working on my project I made me lunch, and then left for tutoring.

**Thursday 21st August**

Thursdays are exciting days because I always have a lot going on on Thursdays. When my sister came home, we left for our piano lessons. After the piano lessons is when the true fun comes, the part I look forward to the whole week. Five-a-side football with my friends. We came up against a fairly strong team, but we still won. I scored a couple of goals and played well even if I say so myself.

**Friday 22nd August**

I woke up fairly late on Friday, since I was worn out from the day before. I ate, the showered and got dressed and prepared myself to go to mosque for jumuah. At mosque, the imam spoke about the vastness of Allah’s forgiveness, and that was the key point I took home with me. Later on I went to pick up my girlfriend and we went to get milkshakes.

**Sunday 24th August**

Also one of the days I look forward to in the week, because it is when we play Sunday league football. Our team (Drifters FC) is lying bottom of the table unfortunately. Nevertheless I always look forward to Sundays because I get to play football with my friends. I captained the team today, as our actual captain was unavailable. I was given the duty by the coach and I had to lead the team out. We were missing a lot of our players and as captain I had to make some big calls regarding the lineup. I scored a goal in the second half, but unfortunately we still lost 4-2.
